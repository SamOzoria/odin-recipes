    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Olives</li>
        <li>Seasoning</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><p>In a bowl combine chicken, salt, oregano, cilantro, pepper, bell pepper, onion, celery, garlic, capers, olives, and lime juice.</p>
            <p>Mix well, and let it rest for 30 minutes.</p></li><br>
        <li><p>In the cast iron or aluminum pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat, reserving 2 tablespoons for later use. Add the sugar to the heated.</p>
            <p>When the sugar turns dark brown, add the chicken (reserving the vegetables and herbs from the marinade), being careful not to splash the oil. Stir for one minute.</p>
            <p>Add the vegetables from the marinade, auyama, tomato sauce, and stir to combine. Add 2 cups of water and bring to a boil.</p></li> <br>
        <li><p>Taste the water and season with salt to taste. Add the rice and stir often to prevent it from sticking too much to the bottom.</p>
            <p>Once the water has evaporated, cover with a tight-fitting lid and cook over low heat for 15 minutes. Uncover and stir, moving the rice from the bottom to the top.</p>
            <p>Cover and cook for another 5 minutes. Taste the rice to see if it is ready; it should be firm but tender inside. If it is not fully cooked, cover and cook for another 5 minutes.</p></li>
    </ol>
