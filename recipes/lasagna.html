    <h1>A Lasagna</h1>

    <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>

    <p>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days. Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Garliv</li>
        <li>Sauce</li>
        <li>Bell pepper</li>
        <li>Italian seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Put pasta water on to boil:
            Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</li>
        <li>Brown the ground beef:
            In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.</li>
        <li>Cook the bell pepper, onions, and garlic; add back the beef:
            Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet (in the photo we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions).
            
            Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce:
            Transfer the beef mixture to a medium-sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.</li>
    </ol>
